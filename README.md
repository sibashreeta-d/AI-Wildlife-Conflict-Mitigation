# AI-Wildlife-Conflict-Mitigation


## 1. Problem Statement

Forest-edge villages face increasing wildlife intrusions that damage crops, kill livestock, and threaten human safety. Due to the lack of early detection systems and structured awareness mechanisms, communities often react with panic or retaliation, harming endangered species and disrupting ecological balance. There is a need for an intelligent, accessible system that detects wildlife presence, predicts risk patterns, and guides safe, non-lethal response strategies.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. The system shall accept image and audio inputs from simulated multi-sensor sources.
2. The system shall detect wildlife species using AI models (image and audio-based).
3. The system shall validate detections using an ML-based filtering model to reduce false positives.
4. The system shall classify risk based on species, zone, time of day, and historical patterns.
5. The system shall generate species-specific, context-aware safety instructions.
6. The system shall send structured alerts to registered villagers via SMS or push notifications.
7. The system shall create a temporary incident-based chat group for coordinated response.
8. The system shall allow villagers to report sightings and upload incident details.
9. The system shall store detection logs and incident data in a historical database.
10. The system shall predict high-risk zones and seasons using historical data.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

1. The system shall respond within a few seconds of wildlife detection.
2. The system shall minimize false alerts using ML validation.
3. The system shall support multi-zone configuration.
4. The system shall be scalable to support multiple villages.
5. The system shall operate using open-source or free-tier technologies.
6. The system shall provide simple and accessible alerts suitable for rural users.
